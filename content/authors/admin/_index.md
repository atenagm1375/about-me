I am a PhD student in Computational Neuroscience at the lab of [Friedemann Zenke](https://www.zenkelab.org) at the [Friedrich Miescher Institute](https://www.fmi.ch), where I am working on understanding the computational principles of predictive learning in the brain. Specifically, I am interested in how the brain learns to predict the future from a stream of sensory stimuli through time and how cortical circuits can implement such predictive learning.

I completed my MSc in Computer Science at the University of Tehran under the supervision of [Mohammad Ganjtabesh](https://www.cnrl.ut.ac.ir), where I studied the computational models of Theory of Mind and developed a simple spiking model of imitative reinforcement learning. During my master's, I also collaborated in a project on self-supervised representation learning for online handwriting applications.

Before that, I received my BSc in Computer Science from the University of Tehran, where I worked on a project on developing an accelerated python framework for spiking neural networks.
